# Tasker
My submission for the PA High School Media and Design Fair 2019. A task management app that prioritizes for you.

## Code Walkthrough
The code has four main focal points that developers will need to dive in.

`App.js` - the App's entry point, which defines all the assets and loads up the navigation view, as well as the Firebase connection.

`/data` folder - stores some data classes, which contain functions for processing Tasks and Dates.

`/screens` folder - stores the actual screens, which show the user interface to the user and populate it with data.

`/components` folder - reusable individual components for the screens

The `/screens` and `/components` folder are where you would go to edit the user interface, and `/data` is where you would edit the backend code. The language used is JavaScript; more specifically, ES5 (its 2015 version).
